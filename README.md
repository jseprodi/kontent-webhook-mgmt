- **Bulk Operations**: Manage multiple webhooks efficiently

### Testing & Debugging
- **Real-time Testing**: Test webhooks instantly with one-click testing
- **Response Monitoring**: View detailed delivery results and status codes
- **Performance Metrics**: Track response times and success rates
- **Delivery Logs**: Historical view of all webhook attempts

### Advanced Features
- **Trigger Management**: Configure multiple event triggers per webhook
- **Custom Headers**: Add authentication and custom headers
- **Environment Support**: Switch between different Kontent.ai environments
- **Status Monitoring**: Visual indicators for webhook health

- **Search & Filter**: Find webhooks quickly with advanced filtering
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **State Management**: React Context + useReducer
- **Routing**: React Router DOM
- **Kontent.ai Integration**: Custom App SDK + Management API v2

## üì¶ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ 
- npm or yarn
- Kontent.ai project with Management API enabled
- Custom App configured in your Kontent.ai environment

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd kontent-webhook-manager
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## üîß Configuration

### Kontent.ai Setup
1. Enable Management API in your Kontent.ai environment
2. Create a Management API key in Project Settings ‚Üí API Keys
3. Note your Environment ID from the environment settings
4. **Configure Custom App** in Environment Settings ‚Üí Custom Apps:
   - Set the hosted code URL to your deployed app
   - Configure roles that can access the app
   - Add any JSON parameters for app configuration
5. The app will automatically detect your environment and user context

### Environment Variables
**Note**: When deployed as a Custom App, the app automatically detects your environment context through the Custom App SDK. No environment variables are needed for basic functionality.

For development/testing, you can create a `.env` file:
```env
VITE_KONTENT_ENVIRONMENT_ID=your_environment_id
VITE_KONTENT_API_KEY=your_management_api_key
VITE_KONTENT_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
```

## üì± Usage

- Quick actions (test, edit, delete)
- Status indicators and delivery statistics

### Webhook Creation/Editing
- Visual form builder for webhook configuration

## üîå API Integration

### Custom App SDK
The app uses the [Kontent.ai Custom App SDK](https://kontent.ai/learn/docs/custom-apps#a-use-custom-app-sdk-for-extra-context) to automatically detect:
- **Environment ID** - for API requests
- **User Information** - ID, email, and roles for access control
- **App Configuration** - JSON parameters from Custom App settings
- **Context** - information about where the app runs

### Management API v2
The app integrates with Kontent.ai's Management API v2 for webhook operations:

- **List Webhooks**: `GET /projects/{environment_id}/webhooks`
- **Create Webhook**: `POST /projects/{environment_id}/webhooks`
- **Update Webhook**: `PUT /projects/{environment_id}/webhooks/{id}`
- **Delete Webhook**: `DELETE /projects/{environment_id}/webhooks/{id}`

## üéØ Supported Webhook Triggers

- Content item variant changes (created, updated, deleted)
- Workflow step changes
- Publishing/unpublishing events
- Asset operations (created, updated, deleted)

## üöÄ Deployment

### Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```

### Deploy as Custom App
1. Build the application
2. Upload the `dist` folder to your web server
3. Configure the app in Kontent.ai Custom Apps
4. Set the app URL to your deployed application

### Docker Deployment
```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production
COPY . .
RUN npm run build
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

## üîí Security Considerations

- API keys are stored securely and never exposed in the UI
- All API calls use HTTPS
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting support
- Environment isolation
